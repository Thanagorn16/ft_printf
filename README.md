## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

`ft_printf` is a project developed as part of the **42 School** curriculum, aiming to reimplement the standard C `printf` function. This project enhances understanding of variadic functions, format specifiers, and output formatting in C.

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To create a function that mimics the behavior of `printf`.
- To handle various format specifiers for different data types.
- To manage variable argument lists using `stdarg.h`.

### âœ¨ Technologies Used

- **C language** â€“ For low-level system programming.
- **Make** â€“ For build automation via a `Makefile`.

### ðŸ’¡ Challenges Faced

- Handling variable argument lists and ensuring type safety.
- Implementing various format specifiers and ensuring accurate output.
- Managing buffer overflows and ensuring memory safety.
